Loading modules
===============

There is a prebuilt module for FUN3D that is built with Yoga on K,
which can be found by:

.. code-block:: bash

    user@k-li1% module avail FUN3D-Yoga

The modules are versioned by the date they were deployed;
loading the most recently deployed module is recommended.


.. code-block:: bash

    user@k-li1% module load FUN3D-Yoga/##VERSION##
