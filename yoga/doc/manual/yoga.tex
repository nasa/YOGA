\section{Yoga}\label{s:yoga}
\emph{This section will be expanded substantially for the next release of FUN3D.}

Yoga is an overset grid assembler \cite{druyor-phd-thesis-overset} that can be used with FUN3D
to enable large-scale overset simulations \cite{druyor-overset-scaling}. 
Yoga uses a modified wall-distance criteria to determine appropriate locations for 
overset boundaries and has several interpolation strategies available (by default, linear least squares).
