\subsection{Yoga Input Files}\label{s:yoga.input_files}
Yoga has an optional ASCII input file for setting the order, node counts, and grid-imesh
values for the component grids within the composite grid file.  
This file can be used in lieu of setting the values via namelist
(as described in the\&overset\_data namelist section).
If Yoga is used to create the composite grid, 
Yoga will generate this file as a by-product.  
For example, if Yoga is used to generate a composite grid
from two component grids, where the first grid has 700 nodes and the second grid
has 600 nodes, Yoga will generate a file with the default name $imesh.dat$ with
the following contents:

\begin{verbatim}
2
700 1
600 0
\end{verbatim}

From this file, FUN3D will determine which nodes in the composite belong to each component
grid and what $imesh$ value to assign each component.
